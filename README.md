# Welle-devices-emulation
SuperCollider app that emulates physical [Tangible Signals](https://tamlab.ufg.at/projects/tangible-signals/) devices for MIDI connectivity tests during [Welle](https://github.com/JnsVttr/Welle) website developement. In the app three devices are emulated (wheel, pins, string). The string device can be assigned to two sound aspects: eq and envelope.

Select midi device to receive and send midi CC messages from/to _Welle_.

The app is made standalone with [sc_osx_standalone](https://github.com/dathinaios/sc_osx_standalone) by [@dathinaios](https://github.com/dathinaios) and bundle as Mac OSX app using [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus)
